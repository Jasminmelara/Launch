Players had worked their way through an abandoned mine on the outskirts of a once booming Dwarven civilization. Upon reaching the final chamber, they came face to face with a mad Dark Elf and his unnatural experiments/abominations. Before the battle commenced, he offered the following to the wide-eyed party:
"Poor little children, afraid and alone, Trying their hardest, to unreap what I've sown. But in the darkness, they cannot see, For that which should frighten them, is.. not.. me.."
It is also important to note that we play by candlelight at the table. As that final word slipped between his cracked lips, I blew out the flickering flame, rendering my living room in complete darkness before playing a loaded audio clip of the scariest, most primal growl I could find.
