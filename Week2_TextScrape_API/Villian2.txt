I'm driven forward unlike any creature this world has ever known. The pain and suffering of my people can no longer be ignored. The world will see me rise up from the ashes of this city and know the Galston people return with fury and hellfire at their backs. I step out into the world with the sole purpose of it's destruction, and how does the world great me? They send me a rag tag bunch of vagrants who know nothing more than fighting and murder. You have no understanding of what my people lost, but after today you'll begin to feel but a fraction of our pain.
This is when the people I played with finally understood they were playing murderhobos
